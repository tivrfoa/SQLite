## Database is mission-critical

Losing it means losing control of your business.

You should choose a mature and battle-tested database software.

Be careful with forks and rewrites — there’s often little to gain, but a lot to lose.

## How SQLite is tested

From: [https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html](https://www.sqlite.org/testing.html)

The reliability and robustness of SQLite is achieved in part by thorough and careful testing.

As of version 3.42.0 (2023-05-16), the SQLite library consists of approximately 155.8 KSLOC of C code. (KSLOC means thousands of "Source Lines Of Code" or, in other words, lines of code excluding blank lines and comments.) By comparison, the project has 590 times as much test code and test scripts - 92053.1 KSLOC.
